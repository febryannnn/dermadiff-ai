# DermaDiff

DermaDiff investigates whether diffusion-based synthetic augmentation improves
classification of rare minority classes in the HAM10000 skin lesion dataset.
Multiple diffusion generators are compared by training a PanDerm ViT-Large
classifier on real + synthetic images and measuring performance across all 7 diagnostic classes.

Pre-trained adapter weights are bundled in the repo, so results can be
reproduced from the generation phase onward without GPU-intensive fine-tuning.

## Experiment Overview

| Experiment | Generator | Rank | Macro F1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Exp A (baseline) | None (real HAM10000 only) | - | 0.8114 |
| Exp B | SD 2.1 LoRA | 16 | 0.8218 |
| Exp C | SDXL LoRA | 16 | 0.8409 |
| Exp D | SD 3.5 Large | 64 | 0.8482 |
| Exp E | SDXL DoRA | 8 | 0.8471 |

**Key finding:** Exp E matches Exp D's classification benefit with a 3x
smaller adapter (rank 8 vs rank 16) and a smaller base model (SDXL vs SD 3.5).
FID and downstream Macro F1 are inversely correlated, Exp D has the worst FID
(235.0) but the best classification benefit. LPIPS diversity is the strongest
predictor of downstream improvement, supporting the "diversity-over-fidelity"
hypothesis.

## Pipeline Overview

![alt text](assets/model_spesific_pipeline.png)

Each experiment directory under `models/` follows the same Phase structure.


## Setup

```bash
# Install base Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Clone PanDerm 
git clone https://github.com/SiyuanYan1/PanDerm.git
```

Phase 1 training scripts are **bundled in this repo** from diffusers v0.37.1,
so you do not need to clone diffusers separately. If you prefer to use your
own diffusers checkout, pass `--diffusers_dir /path/to/diffusers` to the
Phase 1 wrapper. The bundled script is used as a fallback.

### Reproducibility Notes

**Bundled training scripts:** Both `train_text_to_image_lora_sdxl.py` (Exp C)
and `train_dreambooth_lora_sdxl.py` (Exp E) are committed directly from
diffusers v0.37.1. They are treated as read-only reference code, the Phase 1
wrappers (`fine_tuned_LoRA.py`, `fine_tuned_DoRA.py`) have a
`resolve_train_script()` helper that prefers these bundled scripts, with
`--diffusers_dir` as an optional override. This eliminates the need to install
diffusers from source.

**PanDerm PyTorch compatibility:** Phase 3 automatically patches PanDerm's
`run_class_finetuning.py` to add `weights_only=False` to its `torch.load()`
calls. This is required for PyTorch 2.6+ compatibility. Without the patch,
loading the pretrained PanDerm checkpoint raises an exception because newer
PyTorch versions default `weights_only=True` for security. The patch is
idempotent and only applied once per checkout.

**PanDerm timm version lock:** `requirements.txt` pins `timm==0.9.16` because
newer timm versions break PanDerm's ViT loading code. This is a documented
PanDerm constraint, not specific to DermaDiff.

You also need the pretrained PanDerm checkpoint
(`panderm_ll_data6_checkpoint-499.pth`), download manually from the PanDerm
GitHub release page: https://github.com/SiyuanYan1/PanDerm

## Dataset Access

DermaDiff uses three datasets, each with different access requirements. Only
HAM10000 is strictly required ISIC 2019 and the longitudinal dataset are
optional augmentation sources that improve LoRA training quality when
available.

### 1. HAM10000 (required, auto-downloadable)

HAM10000 (Tschandl et al., 2018) is hosted on Harvard Dataverse under a
non-commercial research license and can be downloaded programmatically via
the Dataverse API:

```bash
python dataset/ham10000.py --output_dir ./data/ham10000
```

This script fetches `HAM10000_images_part_1.zip`, `HAM10000_images_part_2.zip`,
and the metadata file, then unpacks everything into the layout that Phase 0
expects: `data/ham10000/images/` (all 10,015 images flat) and
`data/ham10000/HAM10000_metadata.csv`. Download size is roughly 5.2 GB and
takes 10-20 minutes depending on your connection. The script is idempotent;
re-running it is a no-op once the data is in place.

Manual alternative: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DBW86T (Harvard Dataverse).
Download the two image zips + metadata, unpack into the same layout above.

### 2. ISIC 2019 (optional, auto-downloadable)

Used as a supplementary source for fine-tuning images. Your teammate's
`dataset/isic2019.py` script handles the download. See that script's
docstring for exact usage.

Phase 0 works without ISIC 2019 if you omit the `--isic_images` flag.
In that case, only HAM10000 train-split images will be used for fine-tuning, which
produces weaker adapters for small classes (df, vasc) but is still functional.

### 3. Longitudinal Dataset (optional, access-restricted, manual only)

The longitudinal dermoscopic dataset used for the published DermaDiff Exp C
results originates from the University of Queensland (UQ) and is
access-restricted. **It cannot be redistributed in this repository**, and
there is no download script. If you want to reproduce the exact published
training pool:

1. Request access to the UQ longitudinal dermoscopic dataset through the
   original authors or your institution's data access process.
2. Download the full `dataset.zip` (~66 GB) from the UQ-provided source.
3. Extract it locally so that the expected directory layout looks like:
   ```
   data/longitudinal/
   └── dermoscopic_extracted/
       └── 866990d01449152d_NIMARE-A11453_A11453/
           └── data/
               └── Dermoscopic Images/
                   ├── HighRisk Dermoscopic images.xlsx
                   ├── General Dermosopic images.xlsx
                   └── <image files in nested subfolders>
   ```
4. Pass the extraction root as `--longitudinal_dir` and both Excel files
   as `--longitudinal_metadata` when running Phase 0.

**If you don't have longitudinal access**, skip this step entirely. Omit
`--longitudinal_dir` and `--longitudinal_metadata` from the Phase 0
command. Phase 0 will gracefully fall back to using only HAM10000 (and
optionally ISIC 2019) for the per-class training pool. The resulting LoRAs
will train on fewer minority-class images, which may slightly reduce
downstream classifier performance. The published Exp C Macro F1 = 0.8409 was
achieved with all three sources combined.

## Phase 0 - Dataset Preparation (root)

Builds the HAM10000 train/val/test splits and assembles the per-class image
pool for Phase 1. Critical filtering: HAM10000 contributes **train split only**,
ISIC 2019 and longitudinal contribute all images.

```bash
python dataset_prep.py \
    --ham_images ./data/ham10000/images \
    --ham_metadata ./data/ham10000/HAM10000_metadata.csv \
    --isic_images ./data/isic2019/images \
    --longitudinal_dir ./data/longitudinal \
    --longitudinal_metadata \
        "./data/longitudinal/HighRisk Dermoscopic images.xlsx" \
        "./data/longitudinal/General Dermosopic images.xlsx" \
    --output_splits ./outputs/ham10000_splits.json \
    --output_per_class_dir ./outputs/training_images_per_class
```

Outputs:
- `outputs/ham10000_splits.json` - used by Phases 2 (auto train counts) and 3 (CSV building)
- `outputs/training_images_per_class/{mel,bcc,akiec,df,vasc}/` - used by Phase 1
- All images are **symlinked** (no disk duplication)

## Phases 1-4 - Experiment Pipelines

After Phase 0, each experiment follows the same four-phase workflow
(fine-tune, generate, classify, evaluate). Pre-trained adapter weights are
bundled in the repo, so you can skip Phase 1 and start from Phase 2.

See the README inside each experiment directory for commands, hyperparameters,
and experiment-specific notes.

## Hardware Requirements

- **Phase 0:** Any CPU (file I/O only)
- **Phase 1-2:** NVIDIA A100 40GB+ (or T4 with reduced batch)
- **Phase 3:** NVIDIA A100 40GB+
- **Phase 4:** Any GPU with 8GB+ VRAM
